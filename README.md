# Dissertation for BA Geography (Hons)
Here you can find a copy of my dissertation, submitted in 2017 as part of my undergraduate degree in Human Geography at the University of Leeds. 

## About
The study focuses on the demographics of West Yorkshire, and how these may be impacted within the next 25 years due to the EU Referendum. Using the population projection software POPGROUP, Derived Forecast, and training provided by Edge Analytics, population projections were created for the five local authority districts in West Yorkshire: Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds, and Wakefield. 
"What-if" scenarios were created in each projection area that considered a 'low' migration rate, 'current' migration rate, and 'high' migration rate using statistics provided by the ONS.
The projections were brought together to create a county-level population projection and was analysed. The dissertation highlights how the demographics could potentially change by 2039, and what local councils should prepare for.
